## Project Structure

- banking.py: application code
- bank.csv: data file (auto-created with headers on first run)
- README.md: you are here

## Features (Requirements → Implementation)

- Add New Customer: `Transaction.create_account`
- Login / Logout: `Transaction.login`, `Transaction.customer_menu`
- Checking / Savings / Both: `Transaction.create_account` (`has_checking`, `has_savings`)
- Deposit (checking/savings): `Transaction.deposit` → `BankAccount.deposit`
- Withdraw (checking/savings): `Transaction.withdraw` → `BankAccount.withdraw`
- Overdraft protection:
  - Max $100 per withdrawal: `BankAccount.withdraw`
  - Block below −$100 result: `BankAccount.withdraw`
  - $35 fee when crossing to negative: `BankAccount.withdraw`
  - Deactivate on repeated overdrafts: `BankAccount.withdraw`
  - Reactivate when balance becomes non‑negative: `BankAccount.deposit`
- Transfers:
  - Between my accounts: `Transaction.transfer` (t == "1")
  - To another customer: `Transaction.transfer` (t == "2")

## Data Model

Each row in `bank.csv` is one customer with fields:

```text
id, first_name, last_name, password, checking, savings, active, overdraft_count, has_checking, has_savings
```

Type handling:
- Integers: `id`, `checking`, `savings`, `overdraft_count`
- Booleans: `active`, `has_checking`, `has_savings` (stored as "true"/"false")
- Empty balances stored as empty string in CSV; loaded as `None` in memory.

## Classes

- `Customer`: pretty print account info
- `BankAccount`: deposit, withdraw, transfer logic (shared)
- `CheckingAccount` / `SavingsAccount`: thin wrappers setting `account_type`
- `Transaction`: menus, login flow, CSV I/O (`ensure_csv_exists`, `load_customers`, `save_customers`, optional `view_csv`)

## How It Works (CLI Flow)

1) Start app → Main menu
2) Create account or Login
3) After login → Customer menu (Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer, Show Info, Logout)
4) Every successful change persists to `bank.csv`

## Challenges & Takeaways

- Implementing overdraft rules and state (active/reactivation)
- Converting CSV text to proper types and back
- Designing one account engine with two account types

## Icebox Features

- Transaction history log (CSV or JSON)
- View full history and inspect a single transaction
- Automated tests (pytest) for withdraw/deposit/transfer
- Enhanced CLI styling and input validation
